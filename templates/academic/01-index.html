    We are inviting you to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please read this information carefully. Ask us if anything is not clear or you need more information.
  </p>

  <h5>Purpose of the research</h5>
  <p>
    {% if extra_data.academic_account %}We are asking you to participate in our research because you follow the @{{ extra_data.academic_account }} account on Twitter, which is public information. {% endif %}<strong>We plan to test new ways to support people like you, and we would like your feedback on the design, ethics, and privacy of our future study.</strong> This project is independent from Twitter.
  </p>

  <h5>If you participate, what to expect</h5>
  <p>
    In this study, we ask you to imagine a hypothetical scenario where you receive a tweet recommending people to follow, and your information is included in a study on whether including women on lists of follow recommendations has an effect on how many recommendations people follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, we will show you a website that allows people to manage the privacy of the information we collect for the imaginary study. We will ask for feedback on this website with a survey.
  </p>

  <h5>Benefits and risks</h5>
  <p>
    Your answers will help us improve how we manage the privacy of people who participate in our research. We will publish our findings when this study finishes.
  </p>

  {% if amount_dollars %}
  <h5>Compensation</h5>
  <p>
    When you complete the survey, enter your email address, and we will send you ${{ amount_dollars }}.00 via Paypal within the next 24 hours. This offer is valid for 7 days starting when you begin the survey.
