        <h3>Participation in Cornell University Study on Promoting Inclusion and Participation in r/feminism</h3>

        <p>
          Hi {{ user.screen_name }},
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for reading about our study and checking to see if your Reddit account was part of our research. We did find your account in our records, which indicate that you were part of the study:
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>On {{ user.assignment_datetime }}, after you commented for the first time on r/feminism, we included you in the study.</li>
            <li>We sent you a survey link a few weeks later.</li>
            <li>We counted the number of comments you made over eight weeks.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          In our study, we collected and analyzed public information about how often people commented. We want to learn if people comment more if they receive a welcome message from the moderators. We also wanted to know if these messages increase newcomersâ€™ sense of closeness to the community?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is what we collected about your public Reddit behavior for eight weeks starting on {{ user.assignment_datetime }}. When the study is complete, we plan to publish an anonymized dataset that will make no reference to your Reddit ID and will exclude any information about specific dates or the contents of your comments so that it cannot be easily traced back to you. By publishing the data, we can ensure that other researchers can check our conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our dataset includes only the following information and no more:
        </p>

        <div class="data-table">
          <div class="row">

        <h5>Choosing To Opt Out Of This Study</h5>

        <p>
          By allowing us to include the above information in the study, you help us to be confident about the results. If many people choose to opt out, our results may end up skewed. For example, if everyone who does not feel close to the community were to opt out of the study, we might conclude that everyone feels close to the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our research or public statements, we promise never to name you or to reveal any identifying information about you. Yet you may have other reasons to opt out of this study and ask us to remove your information from our analysis. We respect that.
        </p>

        <p class="opt-out-checkbox">
          {{ form.opt_out }} {{ form.opt_out.label }}
        </p>

        <p>Following your preference, we will not include your data in our final analysis or in the public record. We are retaining the information here until {{debriefing_end_date}} so you can manage your privacy.</p>
