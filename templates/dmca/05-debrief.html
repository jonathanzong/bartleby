          Hi {{ user.screen_name }},
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team of researchers at MIT are trying to study the possible side effects of copyright enforcement on people's participation online.
        </p>

        <p>
          TODO
        </p>

        <p>
          To study this question, we have analyzed public records from the <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/">Lumen Database</a>, which is a public record collected by Harvard University of every attempt to remove tweets for alleged copyright reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our study, we have collected and analyzed public information about how often people tweeted before and after receiving a copyright takedown request. We're interested to see if people tweet less on average after their tweets are taken down.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since your Twitter account was mentioned in the Lumen database, information about how often you tweet is in our records. We respect people's rights to privacy and have created this website for you to review what we collected and manage your privacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is what we collected about your public Twitter behavior from [date] to [date]. When we publish our results, we plan to publish anonymized counts of tweeting frequency using methods that make it difficult to re-identify individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our dataset includes only the following information and no more:
