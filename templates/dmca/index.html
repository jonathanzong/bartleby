    <p>
      Thousands of people receive copyright takedown notices every week on Twitter. Whether or not the content violates copyright law, these notices might have side-effectsâ€“ a "chilling effect" of reducing a person's perfectly-legal use of their voice online.
    </p>
    <p>
      From January 9, 2019 to March 8, 2019, our team of researchers at MIT and Dalhousie University looked for evidence of a chilling effect from copyright notices on the behavior of Twitter users.
    </p>
    <p>
      This research was conducted by researchers at MIT and the CivilServant project, which works toward a fairer, safer, more understanding internet, working together with the general public on research. This study is based on years of conversations with people affected by copyright law by Dr. Jon Penney, as well as early data analysis that pointed to a possible chilling effect on Twitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we could not predict whose content would be taken down, we could not ask for permission in advance. Yet we also want to respect the wishes and needs of everyone affected by the study.
